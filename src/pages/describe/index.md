        Primily's Call Assistant relies on a _Call Menu_ for users to select the
        information, leave voicemail or to forward their call to appropriate
        department or extension to speak to a person. 


        The Primily IVR system prompts caller to select an option from the Call
        Menu using keypad responses and incoming telephone calls given the
        selected information or routed to the relevant department.
